# HEALTHCARE - CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM PROJECT

The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is designed to assist healthcare professionals in making clinical decisions by providing patient-specific recommendations and insights based on data analysis and machine learning models.

In this project, we have:
- analysed patients' data and diseases data.
- Applied machine learning models.
- Studied medicine data and provide a medicine recommendation system for the disease.

--------------

Key Features:
- 

- Data Integration and Preprocessing:

Integrate patient data from various sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), diagnostic tests, and medical history.

- Machine Learning Models:

Develop machine learning models for predictive analytics, such as predicting patient outcomes, disease progression, and treatment response.
Train models using supervised learning techniques, including classification, regression, and time-series analysis.
Implement algorithms for anomaly detection and risk stratification to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention.

- Medicine Recommendation System:

Build a recommendation system for suggesting appropriate medications based on patient symptoms, medical history, and treatment guidelines.
Incorporate drug-drug interaction databases and adverse event monitoring to ensure safe and effective medication recommendations.

- Data Analysis and Visualization:

Visualize the analysis results using interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards for better understanding and interpretation.
Identify actionable insights and clinical decision points to guide healthcare professionals in treatment planning and patient management.

----------------------
Technologies and Tools:

- Programming Languages: Python, SQL.
- Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Flask.
- Database Management: SQLite, SQLAlchemy.
