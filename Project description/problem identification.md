**PROBLEMS IDENTIFICATION**

- Data Preparation:

Collect and preprocess a dataset of medical images, along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of specific diseases.
Preprocessing may involve resizing images to a standard size, converting them to grayscale, and normalizing pixel values to ensure consistency across images.

- CNN Model Architecture:

Define a CNN model architecture tailored for disease recognition from medical images. This typically consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by pooling layers for downsampling and fully connected layers for classification.
Choose an appropriate architecture based on the complexity of the task and the size of the dataset. You can use pretrained CNN models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) as a starting point and fine-tune them for your specific task.

- Model Training:

Split the preprocessed dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the CNN model using the training data, providing the images and their corresponding labels as input.
During training, the model learns to extract relevant features from the images and make predictions about the presence or absence of diseases.

- Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the validation set to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
Compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's performance in disease recognition.
Analyze any misclassifications or errors to identify areas for improvement in the model architecture or training process.
