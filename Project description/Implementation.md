IMPLEMENTATION

- Data Acquisition:

Medical image data is acquired from healthcare institutions, radiology departments, or digital imaging repositories. Patient demographics, medical history, and prescription records are 
integrated from electronic health records (EHRs) or clinical databases.


- Model Training and Validation:

CNN models are trained on labeled medical image datasets using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Model performance is evaluated through cross-validation, metrics such as 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and clinical validation studies.


- Integration with Healthcare Systems:

The CDSS is integrated into existing healthcare systems, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems or picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), to ensure seamless workflow integration 
and interoperability with clinical workflows.


- Regulatory Compliance:

Compliance with regulatory standards and healthcare regulations, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) guidelines, 
is ensured to protect patient privacy, confidentiality, and safety.
