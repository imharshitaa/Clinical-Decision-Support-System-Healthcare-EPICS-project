CDSS CODE 1 - MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
-

The code loads patient data, splits it for training and testing, creates logistic regression and decision tree models, combines them into an ensemble, trains the ensemble, evaluates its accuracy, serializes it to a file, and makes predictions on new data, offering a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning workflows.
- Data Loading: It clones a GitHub repository containing a dataset (assumed to be in CSV format) using git clone and then loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv(). The dataset is assumed to contain patient data.
- Data Preprocessing: It preprocesses the dataset by dropping the 'Index' column and replacing NaN values with 0.
- Data Splitting: It splits the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y) and then further splits them into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
- Model Creation: It creates two classification models: a logistic regression model (LogisticRegression) and a decision tree model (DecisionTreeClassifier).
- Ensemble Model: It creates an ensemble model (VotingClassifier) using both logistic regression and decision tree models.
- Model Training: It fits the ensemble model to the training data using ensemble.fit().
- Model Evaluation: It evaluates the ensemble model's performance using k-fold cross-validation and prints the accuracy.
- Confusion Matrix Calculation: It defines a function (confusionMatrix) to calculate and print the confusion matrix metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) using the confusion_matrix function from scikit-learn.
- Model Serialization: It serializes the trained ensemble model using pickle and saves it to a file named 'file.sav'.
- Model Deserialization: It loads the serialized model from the 'file.sav' file back into memory using pickle.
- Model Prediction: It defines a list of input data points (Z), predicts the output labels using the loaded model (loaded_model.predict()), and prints the predictions.

CDSS CODE 2 - CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM APP using flask and sql alchemy
-

This code sets up a Flask web app for a Clinical Decision Support System. It processes patient data, makes predictions using a pre-trained model, and presents results. SQLAlchemy manages a SQLite database for storing patient profiles. Routes handle data submission, viewing, and deletion. The app runs locally with debugging enabled.
- Data Processing Setup: It installs necessary packages and imports required libraries for data processing and web development.
- Web Application Setup: Flask is used to set up routes (@app.route()) for different endpoints like the homepage ('/') and success page ('/success').
- Database Configuration: SQLAlchemy is configured to interact with a SQLite database. A Profile class is defined as a model to represent patient profiles.
- Data Processing: On the '/success' route, the code handles form submission, reads and processes a CSV file containing patient data, and makes predictions using a pre-trained model.
- Data Presentation: It renders an acknowledgment page (Acknowledgement.html) showing the processed data and predictions.
- Database Operations: The '/view' and '/delete/int:inde' routes handle viewing and deleting patient profiles from the database.
- Server Setup: The Flask application is run on a local server (127.0.0.1:5000) with debugging enabled.
- Installation and Cloning: It installs Flask and clones a GitHub repository containing additional project files.

CDSS CODE 3 - DIABETES ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION
-

This code conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds classification models for diabetes prediction using Python libraries. It loads a dataset, prepares and analyzes the data, visualizes relationships, imputes missing values, and trains logistic regression and random forest classifiers, evaluating their performance through accuracy metrics.
- Data Loading: It loads a diabetes dataset from a GitHub repository into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Data Preparation: The code drops unnecessary columns, replaces missing values with zeros, and displays the modified dataset.
- Data Analysis: Basic data analysis is performed, including info, description, null value count, and value counts of specific columns.
- Data Visualization: It visualizes the relationship between 'Insulin' and 'SkinThickness' using a joint plot and computes the correlation matrix.
- Data Imputation: Missing values in 'Insulin' and 'SkinThickness' columns are replaced with the mean values.
- Model Building: Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers are trained on the dataset.
- Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the models is evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy score.
- Data Visualization (continued): A pair plot is created to visualize relationships between variables, differentiated by the 'Outcome' class.

CDSS CODE 4 - MEDICINE RECOMMENDATION
-

This code conducts text-based recommendations for medicines. It preprocesses the data, creates a vectorized representation of medicine descriptions and reasons using CountVectorizer, calculates cosine similarity between medicines, and recommends similar medicines based on input. Finally, it saves the processed data and similarity scores using pickle.
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: It loads a dataset containing information about medicines and preprocesses it by dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and converting text data into a suitable format for analysis.
- Text Vectorization: The text data (medicine descriptions and reasons) are converted into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer. This step transforms text into a matrix where each row represents a medicine and each column represents a unique word from the text corpus.
- Cosine Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity is computed between the vectorized representations of medicines. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a measure of similarity between them.
- Recommendation Function: A function is defined to recommend similar medicines based on a given medicine. It finds the cosine similarity scores between the given medicine and all other medicines, sorts them in descending order, and selects the top similar medicines as recommendations.
- Data Serialization: Finally, the preprocessed data and the similarity scores are saved using pickle. This allows for easy retrieval and reuse of the processed data and similarity scores without needing to rerun the preprocessing steps.
